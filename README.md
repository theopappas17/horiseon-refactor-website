# horiseon-refactor-website

In refactoring the website, I introduced semantic elements that help provide context for html navigation. 
With regard to CSS, there were places where I consolidated the CSS to remove duplicate stylings, but there were also other CSS stylings that could have been consolidated, but I thought that to do so would remove flexibility since they were contextually distinct elements Horiseon might desire to adjust individually in the future.

The website for the github repo is: https://github.com/theopappas17/horiseon-refactor-website.git
The refactored rendered website is available to view here: https://theopappas17.github.io/horiseon-refactor-website/
I believe that the refactored html produces an exact replica of the rendered html I was originally given.
